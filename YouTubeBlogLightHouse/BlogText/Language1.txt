jinn every single animal that walks on
this earth every single bird that takes
the flight in the sky every single fish
that swims in the oceans of allah

their governments and all their military
force and all their might and all their
science and all their money and all
their know-how

sand every mountain every river every
ocean
every ocean one lahi every star every
sun every moon every single planet

and billions of angels all of them with
the exception of none

so you might say brother i am alive
what's so special about that i'm living
but you're living is dependent on his
existence
he's the first with no beginning he's
the last with no ending
he's allah
[Music]
he is allah
al-malik
he's the king
he is the king
[Music]
he is the one who on the day of judgment
when everything will come to an end
when allah will order the destruction of
every living creature
allah will order the destruction the
death of every human of every animal of
every jinn
of every angel
until there comes a point
where there is absolutely nothing in
existence
except allah
and allah will call out
[Music]

where are those kids who thought they
were kings
where are the sons of those kings

to who is the kingdom today who
